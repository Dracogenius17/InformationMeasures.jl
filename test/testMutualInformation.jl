# Tests for mutual information function
# (NB These tests will fail with the shrinkage estimator, because the 1D,
# 2D and 3D distributions on the right will shrink towards different
# targets by default, whereas the mutual information formula overcomes
# by estimating the probabilities of the 3D distribution, then projecting)

# Test mutual information formula
